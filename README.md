# Gardenway - Frontend

This is the **frontend** of Gardenway â€” an e-commerce garden store built using **ReactJS** and deployed via **Netlify**. It consumes data from a Django REST API backend.

[Live Site](https://gardenway.netlify.app/)  
[Backend GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nougat-rey/gardenway)

---

## Project Purpose

Gardenway is a full-stack portfolio project showcasing both backend and frontend development.

To be totally transparent, I had **extensive help from ChatGPT** in the development of the frontend.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nougat-rey/gardenway_frontend.git
cd gardenway_frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://gardenway-11a7983dd747.herokuapp.com/store
REACT_APP_ASSET_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> You can use a local backend for development:
> `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/store`

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

Frontend will be available at:
`http://localhost:3000`

## Lessons Learned

- Building this frontend deepened my understanding of **React components**, **state**, **routing**, and **working with APIs**.
- I relied on **ChatGPT** as a coding partner to help debug, design components, and speed up development.
- Combining it with my own backend gave me valuable full-stack experience.

To deploy your own:

1. Fork this repo
2. Set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable in Netlify settings
